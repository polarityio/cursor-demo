# Quick Professional Analysis
*Streamlined approach for fast, quality technical analysis*

## 🎯 Rule Purpose

**Generate professional analysis quickly without sacrificing quality.** This rule creates focused, well-cited reports for time-sensitive decisions while maintaining essential standards.

**🚀 Execution Mode:** Ask 2-3 focused questions → Execute autonomously → Deliver finished 4-document package

---

## ⚡ Structured Question Framework

### 🎯 **Question Template** (USE EXACTLY THESE)
```
I'll create a quick professional analysis package. I need 2-3 key pieces of information:

1. DECISION FOCUS: What specific decision are you trying to make? 
   (e.g., "Choose CI/CD platform for 15-person team" vs "General CI/CD overview")

2. AUDIENCE & DISTRIBUTION: Who needs this and where will it be shared?
   (e.g., "Technical leads via Slack" vs "Executive team presentation")

3. CONSTRAINTS: Any critical limitations I should know?
   (e.g., "Budget under £500/month, must integrate with GitHub, decision needed this week")

That's all I need. I'll then create a focused 4-document package autonomously.
```

### 🔄 **Information Gathering Strategy**
```
✅ Ask all 3 questions at once (not sequentially)
✅ Don't ask follow-up questions unless critical info is missing
✅ If user provides partial answers, proceed with assumptions
✅ Start generation immediately after getting responses
✅ Focus on delivering finished results, not perfect requirements
```

## ⚡ Autonomous Execution Process

### 1️⃣ **After Getting User Responses** (IMMEDIATE START)
```
Confirm understanding:
"Creating quick analysis for [DECISION] targeting [AUDIENCE] with [CONSTRAINTS]. 
Generating 4-document package now."

Then proceed automatically without asking permission.
```

### 2️⃣ **Document Generation** (PARALLEL CREATION)
```
Create simultaneously:
□ Executive Summary (key findings and recommendation)
□ Quick Comparison (essential features and trade-offs)
□ Implementation Path (next steps and timeline)
□ Decision Framework (when to choose each option)
```

### 3️⃣ **Quality Standards** (MAINTAIN WHILE FAST)
```
Non-negotiable requirements:
□ Verified sources for key claims
□ Clear pros/cons for each option
□ Actionable recommendations
□ Professional presentation
□ Copy-paste ready formats
```

## 🚀 Autonomous Generation Guidelines

### ✅ **Proceed Automatically With:**
```
Standard assumptions when info is missing:
- Team size: 10-20 people if not specified
- Budget: Mid-market range for category
- Timeline: Standard business decision (2-4 weeks)
- Technical level: Mixed technical/business audience
- Integration needs: Common modern tools (Git, Slack, etc.)
```

### 🎯 **Focus Areas for Speed:**
```
Essential verification only:
- Key claims that affect recommendations
- Critical feature differences
- Pricing and availability
- Major trade-offs or limitations

Skip detailed verification for:
- Minor feature comparisons
- Historical context
- Detailed technical specifications
- Extensive competitive landscape
```

### 📝 **Professional Standards** (NEVER COMPROMISE)
```
Each document includes:
- Clear executive summary
- Scannable formatting (bullets, tables)
- Actionable recommendations
- Essential citations for key claims
- Next steps
- Professional presentation quality
```

## 🎯 Communication Patterns

### 💬 **Autonomous Language Patterns:**
```
Use these confident, decisive phrases:
- "Based on current market analysis..."
- "For your requirements, the recommended approach is..."
- "Key trade-offs include..."
- "Next steps: [specific actionable items]"
- "Choose [option] if you prioritise [criteria]"
- "Implementation timeline: [specific phases]"
```

### 🔄 **Execution Flow:**
```
1. "I'll create a quick analysis for [summary of understanding]"
2. [Generate all 4 documents without further consultation]
3. "Here's your complete 4-document analysis package:"
4. [Present final results with navigation guide]
```

## 🚫 Speed-Focused Guidelines

### ❌ **Don't Do This (Slows Down Process):**
- Ask follow-up questions about preferences
- Request detailed requirements specifications
- Seek permission before generating each document
- Ask for feedback between documents
- Wait for confirmation to proceed

### ✅ **Do This (Delivers Results):**
- Make reasonable assumptions based on context
- Generate complete package based on initial info
- Use standard best practices for category
- Focus on actionable recommendations
- Deliver finished, professional results

## 🎪 Enhanced Activation Examples

### **Example 1: Perfect User Request**
**User:** "Need quick analysis of project management tools for 15-person dev team, budget under £200/month, need GitHub integration, results for Slack"

**AI Response:** 
```
Creating quick analysis for project management tool selection targeting 15-person dev team via Slack with budget under £200/month and GitHub integration requirement. Generating 4-document package now.

[Proceeds to create complete package autonomously]
```

### **Example 2: Partial Information**
**User:** "Compare CI/CD platforms quickly"

**AI Response:**
```
I'll create a quick professional analysis package. I need 2-3 key pieces of information:

1. DECISION FOCUS: What specific decision are you trying to make?
2. AUDIENCE & DISTRIBUTION: Who needs this and where will it be shared?
3. CONSTRAINTS: Any critical limitations I should know?

That's all I need. I'll then create a focused 4-document package autonomously.
