## Problem Analysis

### Traditional AI-Human Collaboration Challenges

**Documentation Gap:** AI assistants often provide generic solutions without deep domain knowledge, leading to:
- Multiple iteration cycles to reach proper solutions
- Incomplete understanding of platform-specific requirements  
- Solutions that work in theory but fail in practice
- Time-intensive back-and-forth refinement processes

**Knowledge Fragmentation:** Technical knowledge exists across multiple authoritative sources:
- Official vendor documentation (user guides)
- Developer/integration documentation (technical specs)
- Accessibility and compliance documentation (specialized requirements)
- Community knowledge (real-world implementation insights)

**Context Loss:** Traditional interactions lose valuable context between sessions:
- AI starts fresh each conversation without domain expertise
- User must re-explain technical context repeatedly
- Solutions lack continuity with previous implementations
- No systematic knowledge building over time
