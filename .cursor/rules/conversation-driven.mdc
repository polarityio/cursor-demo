## Core Conversation Patterns

### 1. Question-First Development

**Always Begin with Structured Questions:**

```markdown
**Question Framework for AI Collaboration:**

🎯 Context Setting:
"I'm working on [specific feature/problem] in [language/framework]. 
My experience level with [technology] is [beginner/intermediate/advanced]. 
The current issue is [specific problem description]."

🔍 Specific Technical Questions:
"For [specific function/component], should I use [approach A] or [approach B]?
The tradeoffs I'm considering are [list specific concerns].
My constraints are [time/performance/compatibility requirements]."

📋 Implementation Guidance:
"Can you help me implement [specific functionality] that:
- Handles [edge case 1] and [edge case 2]
- Follows [security/performance] best practices
- Integrates with [existing system component]
- Is testable and maintainable"

🔧 Review and Optimization:
"I've implemented [feature] using [approach]. Can you review for:
- Security vulnerabilities in [specific areas]
- Performance bottlenecks in [operations]
- Code clarity and maintainability
- Edge cases I might have missed"
```

**Example Conversation Starter:**

```markdown
**Context:** Building user authentication for a Node.js API

**Effective Question:**
"I'm implementing JWT-based authentication for a Node.js Express API. I'm intermediate with Node.js but new to JWT security best practices. 

The specific challenge: I need to handle token refresh without exposing security vulnerabilities. Should I use:
1. Short-lived access tokens (15 min) + long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
2. Medium-lived access tokens (2 hours) with rotation
3. Some other approach?

My constraints:
- High security requirements (financial data)
- Mobile app needs to stay logged in
- Must handle token invalidation for logout
- Redis available for token storage

What would you recommend and what security considerations should I implement?"

**Integration:** [Security Practices](security-practices.mdc#api-security)
```

### 2. Iterative Development Conversation

**Break Work into Conversation-Sized Chunks:**

```markdown
**Conversation Chunk Guidelines:**

⚡ Small Chunks (15-30 minutes):
- Single function implementation
- Specific bug fix with context
- Code review of one file/feature
- Debugging one specific error

🔄 Medium Chunks (30-60 minutes):
- Feature implementation with tests
- Refactoring one module/component
- Performance optimization of specific area
- Integration of external service

🏗️ Large Chunks (1-2 hours):
- Architecture design discussion
- Multiple related features
- Complex debugging investigation
- System integration planning
```

**Chunk Transition Pattern:**

```markdown
**Conversation Flow Management:**

✅ Completion Verification:
"Before we move to the next piece, let me verify:
- Does this solve the original problem we identified?
- Are there any edge cases we should test?
- Should we commit this change before proceeding?
- What assumptions are we making for the next step?"

📋 Context Transfer:
"Now that we've completed [specific task], the next logical step is [next task].
Here's what we've established:
- [Decision 1] with reasoning [reason]
- [Decision 2] with tradeoffs [tradeoffs]
- [Current state] and [what we're building next]"

🎯 Focus Maintenance:
"Our original goal was [goal]. We've completed [progress]. 
Remaining work: [specific tasks]
Should we continue with [next task] or re-evaluate priorities?"
```

## Advanced Conversation Techniques

### 4. Verification-Driven Dialogue

**Build Verification into Every Conversation:**

```markdown
**Verification Patterns:**

🔍 Understanding Verification:
"Let me confirm my understanding:
- You're suggesting [approach] because [reasoning]
- This addresses [problem] by [mechanism]  
- The tradeoffs are [benefits] vs [costs]
- Is this accurate?"

🧪 Implementation Verification:
"Before I implement this solution:
- Should I write tests first or implement first?
- What edge cases should I consider?
- How should I handle error scenarios?
- Are there security implications I should address?"

✅ Completion Verification:
"I've implemented the solution. Let me verify:
- Does it solve the original problem?
- Are the tests comprehensive?
- Is the code maintainable and clear?
- Should we refactor anything before moving on?"

🎯 Direction Verification:
"We've made good progress. Before continuing:
- Are we still aligned with the original goal?
- Should we prioritize differently based on what we've learned?
- Is this the right time to commit our changes?
- What should we tackle next?"
```

### 5. Error-Driven Learning Conversations

**Use Errors as Learning Opportunities:**

```markdown
**Error Analysis Conversation Pattern:**

🚨 Error Reporting:
"I'm getting this error: [exact error message]
Context: [what I was trying to do]
Environment: [development/staging/production]
Steps to reproduce: [specific actions]

Before this error:
- [Last working state]
- [Recent changes made]
- [External factors that changed]"

🔍 Error Investigation Dialogue:
"Let's investigate this systematically:
1. What does this error message tell us?
2. What are the most likely causes?
3. How can we test each hypothesis?
4. What evidence should we gather?

Let me start with [specific investigation step] and report back."

📚 Learning Extraction:
"Now that we've solved this error:
- What was the root cause?
- How could we have prevented it?
- What should we add to prevent recurrence?
- What patterns can we learn for similar issues?"
```

**Error Investigation Template:**

```markdown
**Collaborative Error Investigation:**

**Error Details:**
```
[Exact error message]
[Stack trace if available]
[Error code/HTTP status]
```

**Context:**
- **What I was doing:** [Specific action/operation]
- **Expected result:** [What should have happened]
- **Actual result:** [What actually happened]
- **Environment:** [Development setup, browser, OS]

**Investigation Done:**
- [x] Checked recent changes
- [x] Verified environment setup  
- [ ] Tested in different environment
- [ ] Checked external service status

**Questions for AI:**
1. What does this error typically indicate?
2. What are the most common causes?
3. How should I investigate systematically?
4. What information should I gather next?

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand root cause mechanism
- Learn prevention strategies
- Improve debugging skills
- Document solution for team
```

### 6. Architecture Discussion Patterns

**Structure Conversations About System Design:**

```markdown
**Architecture Conversation Framework:**

🏗️ Problem Definition:
"I need to design [system component] that handles [requirements].
Current constraints: [technical/business/time constraints]
Scale considerations: [current users/data volume/growth expectations]
Integration needs: [existing systems/external services]"

🎯 Solution Exploration:
"I'm considering these approaches:
1. [Approach A]: [description] - Pros: [benefits] - Cons: [drawbacks]
2. [Approach B]: [description] - Pros: [benefits] - Cons: [drawbacks]

Which would you recommend given [specific context]?
What alternatives should I consider?
What potential issues should I anticipate?"

📊 Decision Documentation:
"Based on our discussion, here's what I understand:
- **Chosen Approach:** [selected solution]
- **Key Benefits:** [why this approach]
- **Accepted Tradeoffs:** [what we're giving up]
- **Implementation Plan:** [next steps]
- **Success Metrics:** [how we'll measure success]

Does this accurately capture our discussion?"
```

## Conversation Quality Patterns

### 7. Effective AI Prompting Techniques

**Optimize AI Interaction Quality:**

```markdown
**High-Quality Prompt Patterns:**

🎯 Specific Context Prompts:
❌ Poor: "Help me with authentication"
✅ Good: "Help me implement secure JWT authentication for a Node.js API that handles financial data, considering token rotation and mobile app requirements"

🔍 Problem-Focused Prompts:
❌ Poor: "My code doesn't work"
✅ Good: "My JWT verification is failing with 'invalid signature' error after I updated the jwt library from 8.5.1 to 9.0.0. Here's the specific error and code..."

📊 Constraint-Aware Prompts:
❌ Poor: "What's the best way to do this?"
✅ Good: "What's the best approach for [specific task] given these constraints: [performance requirement], [security need], [team experience level], [timeline]?"

🔄 Iterative Prompts:
❌ Poor: "Fix everything in my codebase"
✅ Good: "Let's start with the authentication module. Can you review this specific function for security vulnerabilities, then we'll move to the next component?"
```

### 8. Knowledge Capture and Reuse

**Turn Conversations into Reusable Knowledge:**

```markdown
**Documentation Patterns from Conversations:**

📝 Decision Records:
"Based on our conversation, I'm documenting this decision:

**Decision:** Use Redis for session storage instead of in-memory store
