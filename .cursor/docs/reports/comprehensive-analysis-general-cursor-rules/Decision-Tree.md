## Special Situation Decision Paths

### 🎯 **Specialty Context Decisions**

#### New Team/Startup Context
```
❓ Are you a new team or startup?

Starting from scratch:
✅ Opportunity: Establish good practices from day one
⚠️ Challenge: Limited time and resources

Recommendation:
1. Start: Communication Standards (Week 1)
2. Add: Security Practices (Week 2-3)  
3. Add: Basic Workflow (Month 2)
4. Expand: Based on team growth

Quick setup script:
```bash
# Startup Quick Start
mkdir .cursor/rules
# Copy Communication + Security rules  
# Test with first feature development
# Expand weekly based on needs
```

#### Legacy System Integration
```
❓ Are you working with legacy systems?

Legacy context considerations:
⚠️ Existing code patterns may conflict with new rules
⚠️ Team may have established (different) practices  
✅ Opportunity to improve quality gradually

Recommendation:
1. Start: Communication Standards (non-intrusive)
2. Add: Security Practices (focus on new code)
3. Add: Problem-Solving methodology (for legacy debugging)
4. Gradually: Quality Control as code improves

Strategy: Parallel track approach
- Legacy code: Minimal disruption, focus on security
- New code: Full rule implementation
- Refactored code: Gradually adopt all standards
```

#### Remote/Distributed Team Context
```
❓ Is your team fully remote or distributed?

Remote team considerations:
✅ Extra benefit from Communication Standards
✅ Conversation-Driven development helps coordination
⚠️ Need asynchronous-friendly approaches

Enhanced focus areas:
1. Communication Standards: Extra important for clarity
2. Conversation-Driven: Essential for complex coordination
3. Documentation standards: Critical for knowledge sharing
4. Problem-Solving: Systematic approaches help remote debugging

Remote-specific additions:
- Timezone awareness in communication
- Asynchronous decision documentation
- Clear context preservation across sessions
```

### 🔧 **Technology-Specific Guidance**

#### Frontend-Heavy Teams
```
Frontend focus areas:
✅ Security: XSS prevention, input sanitization
✅ Workflow: Component organization, state management
✅ Quality Control: UI testing, accessibility standards

Recommended emphasis:

2. Security Practices (frontend-specific patterns)  
3. Workflow Principles (component architecture)
4. Quality Control (UI/UX standards)
```

#### Backend/API Teams
```
Backend focus areas:
✅ Security: API security, data validation, authentication
✅ Workflow: Service architecture, database patterns
✅ Problem-Solving: Systematic debugging of distributed systems

Recommended emphasis:
1. Communication Standards (universal)
2. Security Practices (API and data focus)
3. Problem-Solving methodology (complex system debugging)
4. Quality Control (API documentation, testing)
```

#### Full-Stack Teams
```
Full-stack considerations:
✅ Need comprehensive coverage across all areas
⚠️ Risk of too many rules creating confusion

Balanced approach:
1. Start: Communication + Security (universal)
2. Add: Workflow Principles (architecture focus)
3. Add: Quality Control (end-to-end standards)
4. Optional: Problem-Solving + Conversation-Driven (complex projects)
```
