# Transcript Formatting Standards

## Critical Transcript Quality Requirements

- **MANDATORY COPYABLE QUESTION FORMATTING:** ALL questions must ALWAYS be formatted as ONE copyable block containing ALL questions
- **File Metadata:** Include file path, date, session times, model, context window, and status in header
- **Scoped Summaries:** Provide skimmable 5-minute summaries highlighting major points
- **Professional Standards:** Maintain Slack Canvas style formatting with clear visual hierarchy
- **Verification Checkpoints:** Include "VERIFICATION PAUSE POINT" sections with numbered questions
- **Context Documentation:** Capture exact messages, metadata, reasoning steps, and file changes
- **Decision Tracking:** Document all critical decision points with timestamps and rationale

## Required Header Format

```
# [Project/Phase] - [Brief Description]
**File:** `[full-file-path]`  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD] ([Day])  
**Session Start:** [time] [timezone]  
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [timezone]  
**Model:** [model-name]  
**Context Window:** [token-count] tokens  
**Status:** [current-status]  
```

## Question Block Format

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never format questions as separate blocks. Always combine ALL questions into ONE single copyable block:

```
[Optional: Context header like "ðŸ›‘ VERIFICATION PAUSE POINT 1:" or question category]

1. [First question]?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

2. [Second question]?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

3. [Third question]?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

[Continue for all questions...]
```

## Content Structure Requirements

- **Scoped Summaries Section:** Complete overview readable in 5 minutes max
- **Progress Tracking:** Clear status indicators and completion percentages
- **Decision Documentation:** Critical choices with context and rationale
- **Technical Details:** File changes under 300 lines verbatim, summarize larger changes
- **External References:** Verified links with brief (<500 word) summaries
- **Verification Questions:** Ask verification at each step to catch mistakes

## Examples

<example>
**Verification Questions Block:**
```
ðŸ›‘ VERIFICATION PAUSE POINT 1: TDD Environment Setup Complete

1. Directory Structure: Do you see both `server/` and `test-new/` directories created?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

2. Backup Safety: Does `integration-original.js` exist and contain an exact copy?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

3. Test Independence: Does `npm test` still run successfully with all existing tests passing?
- Me: 
- Side Notes: 
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
**NEVER format questions as separate blocks:**
```
1. First question?
- Me:
- Side Notes:
```

```
2. Second question?
- Me:
- Side Notes:
```
</example>

## Conversation Documentation Standards

- **Exact Messages:** Include typos/formatting from original messages
- **Internal Reasoning:** Log behind-the-scenes thought processes
- **Metadata Tracking:** Timestamps, model changes, context window expansions
- **File Change Documentation:** Individual changes under 300 lines verbatim
- **Change Summary:** Larger changes get structured summaries
- **Time Tracking:** Number of iterations and duration
- **Verbosity Control:** Maintain limits per addition to prevent bloat

**REMEMBER: Transcripts serve as project memory and must be comprehensive, accurate, and professionally formatted for future reference and analysis.**
