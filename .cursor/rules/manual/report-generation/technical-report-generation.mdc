# Accuracy-First Technical Report Generation
*Enhanced methodology for high-stakes analysis with verified citations*

## üéØ Rule Purpose

**Generate comprehensive technical analysis with maximum accuracy verification.** This rule prioritises verified data, source quality ratings, and context preservation for critical decision-making.

**üöÄ Execution Mode:** Ask 5-7 comprehensive questions ‚Üí Execute autonomously with verification ‚Üí Deliver finished 8+ document package with source ratings

---

## ‚ö° Structured Question Framework

### üéØ **Question Template** (USE EXACTLY THESE)
```
I'll create an accuracy-first analysis package with 8+ verified documents. I need 5-7 key pieces of information:

1. VERIFICATION SCOPE: What aspects need verified analysis with citations?
   (e.g., "Compare 5 enterprise databases with compliance documentation" vs "General database landscape with source ratings")

2. DISTRIBUTION CONTEXT: Where will this be distributed and what's the stakes level?
   (e.g., "Board presentation for $2M decision" vs "Internal documentation with audit trail")

3. DECISION MAKERS: Who makes decisions based on this analysis?
   (e.g., "CTO and compliance team" vs "Technical committee and procurement")

4. CONTEXT DOCUMENTS: Do you have existing documents I should analyse and reference?
   (e.g., "Current architecture docs and RFP requirements" vs "No existing documentation")

5. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Should I verify all external links and rate source quality?
   (e.g., "Yes, this needs audit-level verification" vs "Standard verification with confidence ratings")

6. STAKES ASSESSMENT: What's the impact level of this decision?
   (e.g., "Mission-critical infrastructure change" vs "Strategic platform evaluation")

7. COMPLIANCE NEEDS: Any specific compliance or citation requirements?
   (e.g., "SOC2/GDPR compliance documentation needed" vs "Standard business analysis")

That's all I need. I'll then create a comprehensive 8+ document package with full verification autonomously.
```

### üîÑ **Information Gathering Strategy**
```
‚úÖ Ask all 5-7 questions at once (comprehensive context gathering)
‚úÖ Don't seek incremental clarification unless critical gaps exist
‚úÖ If user provides partial answers, proceed with high-confidence assumptions
‚úÖ Start accuracy-first generation immediately after getting responses
‚úÖ Focus on delivering verification-complete package, not iterative refinement
```
