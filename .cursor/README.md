## 🔗 Rule Integration Patterns

### Cross-Rule Linking
Each rule file contains relative links to related concepts:

```markdown
Examples of Rule Integration:
• Communication Standards (@rules/always-on/communication-standards.mdc) → Quality Control (@rules/manual/quality-control.mdc) (code review communication)
• Security Practices (@rules/always-on/security-practices.mdc) → Development Workflow (@rules/manual/development-workflow.mdc) (secure TDD practices)  
• Problem-Solving (@rules/always-on/problem-solving.mdc) → Conversation-Driven (@rules/always-on/conversation-driven.mdc) (AI-assisted debugging)
• All rules → Each other (comprehensive cross-references)
```

### Always Apply vs. Context-Specific
```markdown
Always Apply Global (Automatic):
🟢 Communication Standards
🟢 Security Practices (credential detection)

Project-Specific (Manual activation):
🟡 Development Workflow
🟡 Quality Control  
🟡 Problem-Solving
🟡 Conversation-Driven Development
```
