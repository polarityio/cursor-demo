## üìÅ **Detailed Setup Instructions**

### **1. Installation & Configuration**

**Step 1.1: Download and Install**
```bash
# Download from official site
curl -O https://cursor.com/download
# Or visit https://cursor.com directly
```

**Step 1.2: Initial Configuration**
- Launch Cursor
- Sign in or create account
- Choose workspace/project directory
- Configure basic preferences:
  - Theme: Dark/Light preference
  - Font: Recommended - Monaco, SF Mono, or Fira Code
  - Tab size: 2 or 4 spaces
  - Word wrap: Enabled for markdown files

**Step 1.3: Essential Extensions**
- **ESLint:** Required for Cursor's AI-powered lint fixing
- **Path Intellisense:** Intelligent path completion
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Language Features:** Enhanced language support

### **2. Folder Structure Implementation**

**Step 2.1: Create `.cursor` Directory**
```bash
# In your project root
mkdir .cursor
cd .cursor
mkdir rules docs transcripts
```

**Step 2.2: Directory Structure**
```
.cursor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/           # Corrective guidance files (.mdc format)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/           # Domain knowledge files (.md format)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transcripts/    # Conversation logs and session records
```

**Step 2.3: First Rule File**
Create `.cursor/rules/coding-standards.mdc`:
```markdown
---
description: Basic coding standards and conventions
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Coding Standards

## Key Principles
- Use descriptive variable names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent formatting

## Common Corrections
- Avoid single-letter variables except for loops
- Use async/await instead of .then() chains
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
```

### **3. Chat Window Management Mastery**

**Step 3.1: Understanding Window Modes**

**Sidemounted Mode (Default):**
- Integrated into sidebar
- Best for: Quick questions, simple tasks
- Access: Standard chat interface

**Windowed Mode:**
- Separate resizable window
- Best for: Complex file operations, multi-step tasks
- Access: Click window icon in chat header

**Tab Mode:**
- Split chats into separate file tabs
- Best for: Multiple concurrent conversations
- Access: Right-click chat ‚Üí "Open in Tab"

**Step 3.2: Command+L Highlighting**
- Select text in any file
- Press `Command+L` (macOS) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux)
- Chat opens with selected text as context
- Enables precise, contextual assistance

**Step 3.3: Panel Optimization**
- **For Writing:** Windowed mode with wide chat panel
- **For Debugging:** Sidemounted with console visible
- **For Research:** Tab mode with multiple contexts

### **4. Context System Implementation**

**Step 4.1: @Mention System Mastery**

**@web Usage Pattern:**
```
@web typescript best practices 2025
@web cursor ide advanced features
@web voice control macOS setup guide
```

**3-Link Research Strategy:**
1. Start with broad search: `@web [topic] overview`
2. Dive deeper: `@web [specific aspect] implementation`
3. Find examples: `@web [topic] examples tutorials`

**@codebase Integration:**
- Use for understanding existing code patterns
- Ideal for refactoring and consistency checking
- Automatic when files are open and in view

**@rules and @docs Strategy:**
- `@rules` for corrective guidance and standards
- `@docs` for domain knowledge and procedures
- Build incrementally based on project needs

**Step 4.2: Context Management Best Practices**
- **Active Tab Context:** Automatically included, review before asking
- **File Selection:** Choose relevant files manually when needed
- **Context Switching:** Clear chat context between different topics
- **Context Building:** Layer information progressively

### **5. Advanced Workflow Integration**

**Step 5.1: Voice Control Setup (macOS)**

**Enable Voice Control:**
1. System Preferences ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Voice Control
2. Turn on Voice Control
3. Complete one-time download
4. Configure microphone and commands

**Cursor Integration Commands:**
- "Show numbers" - Display clickable number overlays
- "Click [number]" - Click on numbered element
- "Select [text]" - Select specific text
- "Command L" - Open chat with selected text

**Custom Commands Setup:**
1. Voice Control Settings ‚Üí Commands ‚Üí Custom
2. Create cursor-specific commands:
   - "Open chat" ‚Üí Command+L
   - "Switch panel" ‚Üí Panel switching shortcut
   - "Save and run" ‚Üí Save + execute sequence

**Step 5.2: Plan File Workflow**

**Plan File Structure:**
```markdown
# [Project Name] Implementation Plan

## Objectives
- [ ] Primary goal with success criteria
- [ ] Secondary goals with validation steps

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Specific action with deliverable
- [ ] Task 2: Next step with dependencies noted
- [ ] Task 3: Validation and testing steps

## Transfer Learning Notes
- Key insights from previous similar tasks
- Patterns that worked well
- Pitfalls to avoid based on experience
```

**Transfer Learning Pattern:**
1. Create plan file with checkboxes
2. Work through tasks systematically
3. Document what works and what doesn't
4. Use insights for future similar projects
5. Build knowledge base over time

**Step 5.3: Always-On vs Manual Strategy**

**Always-On Recommended For:**
- Code completion and suggestions
- Real-time syntax checking
- Automatic context inclusion
- Basic formatting assistance

**Manual Control For:**
- Complex refactoring decisions
- Architecture and design choices
- Security-sensitive operations
- Performance optimization decisions

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Configuration**

### **Rules vs Documents Strategy**

**Rules (.mdc files):**
- **Purpose:** Corrective guidance, what NOT to do
- **Use For:** Coding standards, common mistakes, style guides
- **Format:** Structured markdown with frontmatter
- **Update Pattern:** Based on recurring issues and corrections

**Documents (.md files):**
- **Purpose:** Domain knowledge, what TO do
- **Use For:** Architecture patterns, business logic, procedures
- **Format:** Standard markdown with examples
- **Update Pattern:** Refined based on successful implementations

### **External Resource Integration**

**Link Management Strategy:**
1. **Quality Assessment:** Verify link authority and recency
2. **Context Building:** Use 3-link pattern for comprehensive coverage
3. **Verification:** Test links before important implementations
4. **Documentation:** Save verified resources in docs folder

**Example Integration:**
```markdown

## üîß **Troubleshooting & Optimization**

### **Common Setup Issues**

**Voice Control Not Working:**
- Check microphone permissions in System Preferences
- Verify Voice Control is enabled in Accessibility
- Test with simple commands first
- Restart Cursor after enabling

**Context Not Loading:**
- Verify file paths in @mentions
- Check that files exist and are accessible
- Clear chat history and retry
- Restart Cursor if persistent

**Performance Issues:**
- Limit context size for large codebases
- Use specific file @mentions instead of @codebase
- Close unnecessary chat tabs
- Check internet connection for @web features

### **Optimization Tips**

**For Large Projects:**
- Create project-specific rule files
- Use folder-based organization in .cursor directory
- Implement selective context inclusion
- Regular cleanup of unused transcripts

**For Team Collaboration:**
- Share rule files via version control
- Standardize folder structures across team
- Document team-specific patterns and conventions
- Regular sync meetings on best practices

**For Long-term Maintenance:**
- Regular review and update of rule files
- Archive old transcripts periodically
- Update external resource links quarterly
- Evolve practices based on team feedback
