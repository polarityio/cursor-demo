**Implementation Pattern:**
```
Problem Definition ‚Üí Context Building ‚Üí Solution Architecture ‚Üí 
Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Documentation ‚Üí Transfer Learning
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Start with the End:** Define success criteria before beginning
- **Build Context Progressively:** Layer information systematically 
- **Document Decision Points:** Capture why, not just what
- **Transfer Learning:** Extract patterns for future use
- **Validation Loops:** Verify at each stage

**Prevents:** AI spiraling, incomplete solutions, repeated mistakes, knowledge loss

**Example Application:**
