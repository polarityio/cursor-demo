## Failed/Inaccessible Sources

### Link Verification Failures
| Source | Status | Error Type | Last Attempt | Alternative Action |
|--------|--------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| [Yabai Issue #1915](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/1915) | ❌ Failed | HTTP 404 | 2025-01-17 | Used cached content from previous verification |

## Source Quality Assessment Criteria

### Authority Scoring
- **High:** Official vendor documentation, primary implementation data
- **Medium:** Open source projects with active maintenance, community forums with established track records
- **Low:** General industry observations, unverified community reports

### Currency Scoring
- **High:** Updated within last 6 months, version-specific documentation
- **Medium:** Updated within last 12 months, generally current practices
- **Low:** Older than 12 months, may contain outdated information

### Completeness Scoring
- **High:** Comprehensive coverage of topic, multiple aspects addressed
- **Medium:** Good coverage with some gaps, focused on specific aspects
- **Low:** Limited coverage, incomplete information

### Bias Assessment
- **Low Bias:** Official documentation, direct observation data
- **Medium Bias:** Vendor documentation with clear commercial interest
- **High Bias:** Opinion pieces, unverified community claims
