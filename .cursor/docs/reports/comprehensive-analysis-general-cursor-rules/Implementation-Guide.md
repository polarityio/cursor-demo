# Cursor Rules Implementation Guide: Step-by-Step Setup

**Generated:** January 15, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Complete implementation procedures for general development rules  
**Audience:** Developers of all experience levels  
**Estimated Time:** 2-16 hours depending on package selected  

## Prerequisites and Environment Setup

### System Requirements
- **Cursor IDE** version 0.40+ (latest recommended)
- **Git** for version control and rule management
- **Basic text editor** familiarity for rule file creation
- **Command line access** for file operations and verification

### Initial Setup Verification
```bash
# Verify Cursor installation
cursor --version

# Check if cursor rules are enabled
# Go to Cursor Settings → General → Rules for AI
# Ensure "Include .cursorrules file" is checked

# Verify Git configuration  
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

### Project Structure Setup
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create Cursor rules directory structure
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Verify structure
tree .cursor/
# Expected output:
# .cursor/
# └── rules/
```

## Phase 1: Communication Standards (Critical - Start Here)

### Step 1.1: Create Global Communication Rules

**File:** `~/.cursor/rules/communication-standards.mdc`

```bash
# Navigate to global rules directory (create if doesn't exist)
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/rules
cd ~/.cursor/rules
```

**Create the rule file:**

# Communication Standards for Development

## Structured Question Format (MANDATORY)

ALL questions must use this copyable format:

```
- [Question text]?
- Me: 
- Side Notes: 
```

Examples:
```
- What's the main goal we're trying to achieve?
- Me: 
- Side Notes: 

- Should I create tests first (TDD approach)?  
- Me:
- Side Notes:
```

## Context Management Rules

### Checkpoint System
- Regular progress verification: "Are we solving the original problem?"
- Scope validation: "Does this align with our current goal?"
- Context summaries when switching between complex tasks

### Error Prevention  
- Validation prompts before major changes
- Assumption declaration for API versions, dependencies, project structure
- Terminal awareness checks before executing commands

## Communication Guidelines

### Language Standards
- Use clear, standard language appropriate for team
- Maintain professional, informative tone
- Avoid overly enthusiastic or exaggerated language
- Focus on specific, actionable communication

### Response Structure
- Explain the next step clearly
- Explain before/after changes
- Explain why a step succeeded or failed
- Be concise and direct

## Memory Management
- Acknowledge when context limits affect decisions
- State assumptions clearly when information is missing
- Reference original goals to prevent scope creep
```

### Step 1.2: Verify Communication Rules Work

```bash
# Test the rules in a new Cursor session
# 1. Open Cursor in your project
# 2. Start a new chat session
# 3. Ask: "Can you help me with a simple code question using the proper format?"
# 4. Verify AI uses the copyable question format
```

**Expected AI Response Format:**
```
I'd be happy to help! Let me ask a few questions first:

- What specific programming language or framework are you working with?
- Me: 
- Side Notes: 

- What's the specific problem you're trying to solve?
- Me:
- Side Notes:
```

### Step 1.3: Team Distribution (Optional)

```bash
# If implementing team-wide, copy to shared location
cp ~/.cursor/rules/communication-standards.mdc /shared/team/rules/

# Or add to project-specific location
cp ~/.cursor/rules/communication-standards.mdc .cursor/rules/

# Commit to version control
git add .cursor/rules/communication-standards.mdc
git commit -m "feat: add communication standards for AI interactions"
```

## Phase 2: Security Practices (High Priority)

### Step 2.1: Create Security Rules

**File:** `.cursor/rules/security-practices.mdc`

```markdown
---
description: Security-first development practices for input validation and credential management
globs: ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts", "**/*.py", "**/*.java", "**/*.cs", "**/*.go"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# Security-First Development Practices

## Input Validation (Critical)

### Always Validate External Data
- User inputs (forms, URL parameters, API requests)
- File uploads and data imports
- Environment variables and configuration
- Database query parameters
- API responses from external services

### Validation Patterns
```javascript
// Example: Input validation pattern
function validateUserInput(input) {
  if (typeof input !== 'string') {
    throw new ValidationError('Input must be string');
  }
  if (input.length > MAX_LENGTH) {
    throw new ValidationError('Input exceeds maximum length');
  }
  return sanitizeInput(input);
}
```

## Credential Detection and Management

### Automatic Detection Patterns
- API keys: `api_key`, `apikey`, `api-key` followed by `=`, `:`, or `"`
- Tokens: `token`, `bearer`, `jwt` followed by `=`, `:`, or `"`
- Secrets: `secret`, `password`, `pwd` followed by `=`, `:`, or `"`
- Connection strings: `mongodb://`, `postgres://`, `mysql://`

### Template-Based Management
- Replace credentials with: `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`
- Use environment variables: `process.env.API_KEY`
- Create `.env.template` files instead of committing `.env`
- Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`

## Error Handling Without Information Disclosure

### Safe Error Responses
```javascript
// Good: Safe error handling
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error: error.message, userId });
  return { error: 'Operation failed. Please try again.' };
}

// Bad: Information disclosure
catch (error) {
  return { error: error.stack }; // Exposes internal structure
}
```

### Error Logging Best Practices
- Log detailed errors internally
- Return generic errors to users
- Include correlation IDs for debugging
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens)

## Dependency Management

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Regular security audits
npm audit --audit-level moderate
yarn audit --level moderate

# Dependency updates
npm update --save
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Safe Dependency Practices
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Regular security updates
- Verify package authenticity
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities
```

### Step 2.2: Test Security Rules

```bash
# Create a test file with intentional security issues
cat > test-security.js << 'EOF'
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef"; // This should trigger detection
const userInput = req.body.data; // This should suggest validation
EOF

# Open in Cursor and verify:
# 1. Credential detection warning appears
# 2. Input validation suggestions provided
# 3. Error handling improvements suggested
```

### Step 2.3: Git Integration

```bash
# Add security rules to version control
git add .cursor/rules/security-practices.mdc
git commit -m "feat: add security-first development practices"

# Set up pre-commit hook for credential detection (optional)
echo '#!/bin/bash
git diff --cached --name-only | xargs grep -l "api_key\|secret\|password" && echo "Warning: Potential credentials detected" || exit 0
' > .git/hooks/pre-commit

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Phase 3: Development Workflow (Medium Priority)

### Step 3.1: Create Workflow Rules

**File:** `.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc`

```markdown
---
description: Development workflow principles including TDD, file organization, and quality gates
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Development Workflow Principles

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Write a failing test** (Red) - Write test for desired functionality
2. **Make test pass** (Green) - Implement minimal code to pass test  
3. **Refactor** (Blue) - Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Commit** - Commit working code before next test

### TDD Implementation
```javascript
// Example TDD pattern
describe('User validation', () => {
  it('should reject invalid email addresses', () => {
    expect(() => validateEmail('invalid-email')).toThrow('Invalid email');
  });
  
  it('should accept valid email addresses', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('user@example.com')).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Micro-Milestone Approach

### Commit-Sized Work Chunks
- Each commit should be a complete, working feature
- Optimize for easy rewinding/reverting
- Include tests in the same commit as implementation
- Keep commits focused on single responsibility

### Commit Message Standards
```bash
# Semantic commit prefixes (REQUIRED)
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve memory leak in data processor  
refactor: extract common validation utilities
test: add integration tests for API endpoints
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
docs: update API documentation
```

## File Organization Principles

### Many Small Files Philosophy
- Prefer creating new files over adding to existing ones
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Single responsibility per file
- Clear, descriptive file names

### File Naming Conventions
```bash
# Good examples
src/utils/validation-helpers.js
src/components/user-profile.component.js
src/services/email-notification.service.js
src/types/user-interfaces.ts

# File structure example
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   │   ├── button.component.js
│   │   └── modal.component.js
│   └── user/
│       ├── user-profile.component.js
│       └── user-settings.component.js
├── services/
│   ├── api.service.js
│   ├── auth.service.js
│   └── notification.service.js
└── utils/
    ├── validation.utils.js
    ├── formatting.utils.js
    └── date.utils.js
```

## Quality Gates and Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- Human-readable over DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Excessive logging during development (remove before commit)
- Dead code deletion (never comment out, delete completely)
- JSDoc or equivalent documentation for new functions

### Quality Checks Before Commit
```bash
# Pre-commit quality checklist
npm run lint          # Code style validation
npm run test          # All tests pass
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation (if applicable)
npm run build         # Successful build
```

## Observability and Logging

### Structured Logging Requirements
```javascript
// Good: Structured logging
logger.info('User login attempt', {
  userId: user.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
  success: true
});

// Include correlation IDs for tracking
logger.error('Database connection failed', {
  correlationId: req.correlationId,
  error: error.message,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### Development vs Production Logging
- **Development:** Verbose logging for debugging
- **Production:** Structured, filterable logs
- **Never log:** Passwords, API keys, personal data
- **Always log:** Errors, security events, performance metrics
```

### Step 3.2: Workflow Implementation Test

```bash
# Create a sample project to test workflow
mkdir workflow-test && cd workflow-test
git init

# Create initial test file
cat > test-example.test.js << 'EOF'
// TDD Example - Red phase
describe('Calculator', () => {
  it('should add two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });
});
EOF

# This should fail (Red) - no implementation yet
# Create implementation (Green)
cat > calculator.js << 'EOF'
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = { add };
EOF

# Test workflow in Cursor:
# 1. Open files and ask AI to suggest improvements
# 2. Verify it follows TDD principles
# 3. Check commit message suggestions
```

## Phase 4: Quality Control Standards (Scaling Teams)

### Step 4.1: Quality Control Rules

**File:** `.cursor/rules/quality-control.mdc`

```markdown
---
description: Quality control standards for testing, documentation, and maintenance
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# Quality Control Standards

## Testing Standards

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for bottlenecks

### Test Organization
```javascript
// Test file naming: [feature].test.js or [feature].spec.js
describe('User Service', () => {
  describe('Authentication', () => {
    it('should authenticate valid credentials', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const credentials = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'valid123' };
      
      // Act  
      const result = await userService.authenticate(credentials);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.token).toBeDefined();
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Execution Standards
- Run tests in single-run mode (no watch mode in CI)
- Fail-fast configuration (stop on first failure)
- Parallel test execution when possible
- Clean test data setup/teardown

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
```javascript
/**
 * Validates user email address format and availability
 * @param {string} email - Email address to validate
 * @param {Object} options - Validation options
 * @param {boolean} options.checkAvailability - Whether to check if email is available
 * @returns {Promise<ValidationResult>} Validation result with success status and errors
 * @throws {ValidationError} When email format is invalid
 */
async function validateEmail(email, options = {}) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Project Documentation
- **README.md:** Setup, usage, and contribution guidelines
- **API Documentation:** All endpoints and parameters documented
- **Configuration Guide:** Environment setup and deployment instructions
- **Changelog:** Track all significant changes

### Documentation Maintenance
- Update docs with code changes in same commit
- Review documentation accuracy during code reviews
- Regular documentation audits (quarterly)
- User feedback integration for documentation improvements

## File Management Standards

### File Size Limits
- Source files: < 300 lines preferred, < 500 lines maximum
- Test files: < 500 lines preferred
- Configuration files: < 100 lines preferred
- Split large files into focused modules

### Cleanup Requirements
```javascript
// Good: Regular cleanup
import { debounce } from 'lodash';
import { validateInput } from '../utils/validation';

// Remove unused imports before commit
// Delete commented-out code
// Remove console.log statements
```

### File Naming and Organization
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Group related files in directories
- Separate concerns (components, services, utilities)
- Clear hierarchy and dependencies

## Performance Standards

### Code Performance Requirements
- Avoid nested loops when possible
- Use appropriate data structures for use case
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Profile and monitor critical paths

### Memory Management
```javascript
// Good: Proper cleanup
function processLargeDataset(data) {
  const results = [];
  
  try {
    for (const item of data) {
      results.push(processItem(item));
    }
    return results;
  } finally {
    // Cleanup if needed
    data = null;
  }
}
```

### Build and Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting for large applications
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Minification and compression for production
- Regular bundle size monitoring
```

### Step 4.2: Quality Integration

```bash
# Set up quality gates in package.json
cat > package.json << 'EOF'
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage",
    "lint": "eslint src/",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "quality-check": "npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test",
    "pre-commit": "npm run quality-check"
  }
}
EOF

# Test quality standards
npm run quality-check
```

## Phase 5: Problem-Solving Methodology (Advanced Teams)

### Step 5.1: Debug and Problem-Solving Rules

**File:** `.cursor/rules/problem-solving.mdc`

```markdown

description: Systematic problem-solving and debugging methodology for development issues
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# Problem-Solving Methodology

## Systematic Diagnosis Framework

### Information Gathering (DIAGNOSE)
Before attempting solutions, gather comprehensive context:

1. **Error Messages and Logs**
   - Complete error stack traces
   - Browser console errors (frontend)
   - Server logs (backend)
   - Database logs (if applicable)

2. **Behavioral Symptoms**
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Steps to reproduce consistently
   - Environment conditions (browser, OS, versions)
   - Recent changes that might be related

3. **System Context**
   - Code architecture relevant to the issue
   - Dependencies and versions
   - Configuration settings
   - Resource usage (memory, CPU, network)

### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process

1. **Observations** - Document what you see happening
2. **Reasoning** - Explain why this is EXACTLY the issue
3. **Evidence** - Provide supporting data for your reasoning
4. **Solution** - Propose fix based on evidence

### Example Problem-Solving Template
```markdown
## Problem Description
[Clear description of the issue]

## Diagnosis
**Symptoms:**
- [What is happening]
- [What should happen instead]

**Evidence:**
- [Error messages]
- [Log entries]
- [Screenshots/outputs]

**Analysis:**
- [Root cause analysis]
- [Why this is happening]

## Solution
**Approach:** [Chosen solution and reasoning]
**Implementation:** [Specific steps]
**Verification:** [How to confirm fix works]
```

## Evidence-Based Solutions

### Root Cause Analysis
- Look for similar patterns in codebase
- Check recent changes that might be related
- Use debugging tools appropriate for technology stack
- Test hypotheses systematically

### Solution Validation
```javascript
// Example: Systematic testing approach
describe('Bug Fix Validation', () => {
  it('should reproduce the original issue', () => {
    // Test that confirms the bug exists in original code
  });
  
  it('should fix the issue with new implementation', () => {
    // Test that confirms the fix works
  });
  
  it('should not introduce regressions', () => {
    // Test that confirms existing functionality still works
  });
});
```

## Verification Protocols

### Fix Confirmation Process
1. **Reproduce Original Issue** - Confirm you can replicate the problem
2. **Apply Fix** - Implement your solution
3. **Verify Resolution** - Confirm issue is resolved
4. **Regression Testing** - Ensure no new issues introduced
5. **Documentation** - Update relevant documentation

### Knowledge Capture
- Document solutions for future reference
- Update team knowledge base
- Share learnings in code review
- Include prevention strategies

## Common Debugging Patterns

### Frontend Issues
```javascript
// Debug browser issues systematically
console.group('Debug Session:', issue);
console.log('Environment:', navigator.userAgent);
console.log('Current State:', currentState);
console.log('Expected State:', expectedState);
console.log('Network Requests:', networkLogs);
console.groupEnd();
```

### Backend Issues
```javascript
// Systematic server debugging
logger.info('Debug Context', {
  endpoint: req.path,
  method: req.method,
  userId: req.user?.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  requestId: req.id
});
```

### Database Issues
```sql
-- Debug database performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1;
-- Check query execution plan and timing
```
```

### Step 5.2: Problem-Solving Practice

```bash
# Create a sample debugging scenario
mkdir debug-practice && cd debug-practice

# Create file with intentional issues
cat > buggy-code.js << 'EOF'
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= items.length; i++) {  // Bug: <= instead of <
    total += items[i].price;
  }
  return total;
}

const cart = [
  { name: 'Item 1', price: 10 },
  { name: 'Item 2', price: 20 }
];

console.log('Total:', calculateTotal(cart));
EOF

# Test problem-solving methodology:
# 1. Open in Cursor
# 2. Ask AI to debug using systematic approach
# 3. Verify it follows DIAGNOSE → REASONING → SOLUTION pattern
```

## Phase 6: Conversation-Driven Development (Expert Teams)

### Step 6.1: Advanced Conversation Rules

**File:** `.cursor/rules/conversation-driven.mdc`

```markdown

description: Conversation-driven development methodology for complex projects
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# Conversation-Driven Development

## Question-First Approach

### Before Any Implementation
Always ask clarifying questions before writing code:

```
- What is the specific goal we're trying to achieve?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

- What are the constraints or requirements I should know about?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

- Are there existing patterns in the codebase I should follow?
- Me:
- Side Notes:

- Should I create tests first (TDD approach)?
- Me:
- Side Notes:
```

### Implementation Planning
- Review the overall goal before starting
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Get approval for approach before implementing
- Document decisions and reasoning

## Continuous Progress Protocol

### Never Stop Until Real-World Criteria Met
- Continue until all tests pass
- Continue until implementation is complete
- Continue until verification confirms solution
- Continue until documentation is updated

### Progress Verification Checkpoints
```markdown
## Checkpoint Questions
1. **Goal Alignment:** Are we solving the original problem?
2. **Scope Validation:** Are we staying within the defined scope?
3. **Quality Check:** Does this meet our standards?
4. **Completion Status:** What remains to be done?
```

### Context Preservation
- Maintain conversation context across sessions
- Reference previous decisions and their reasoning
- Link related conversations and tasks
- Update progress documentation regularly

## Verification and Quality Standards

### Real-World Verification Requirements
- **Code Functionality:** All code must work as intended
- **Test Coverage:** All new code must have tests
- **Integration:** Changes must integrate properly with existing code
- **Documentation:** Changes must be documented appropriately

### Conversation Documentation
```markdown
## Conversation Log Template

### Session Information
- **Date:** [ISO Date]
- **Goal:** [Primary objective]
- **Context:** [Related previous work]

### Decisions Made
- **Decision 1:** [What was decided and why]
- **Decision 2:** [What was decided and why]

### Implementation Notes
- **Approach:** [Technical approach chosen]
- **Challenges:** [Issues encountered and resolved]
- **Next Steps:** [What needs to happen next]

### Verification
- **Tests:** [What tests were created/updated]
- **Manual Testing:** [Manual verification performed]
- **Documentation:** [Documentation updated]
```

## Advanced Project Management

### Task Decomposition
Break complex features into manageable tasks:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Requirements gathering
   - Technical design
   - Risk assessment

2. **Implementation Phase**  
   - Core functionality
   - Edge case handling
   - Error scenarios

3. **Verification Phase**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing

### Progress Tracking
```markdown
## Feature Progress Tracker

### Feature: [Feature Name]
**Status:** [In Progress/Complete/Blocked]
**Completion:** [X%]

#### Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: [Description]
- [ ] Task 2: [Description]  
- [x] Task 3: [Description] ✅ Completed

#### Notes
- [Implementation notes]
- [Challenges and solutions]
- [Decisions made and reasoning]
```
```

### Step 6.2: Full Implementation Verification

```bash
# Verify all phases are working together
cd your-project

# Check rule files exist
ls -la .cursor/rules/
# Expected: communication-standards.mdc, security-practices.mdc, 
#           development-workflow.mdc, quality-control.mdc,
#           problem-solving.mdc, conversation-driven.mdc

# Test integrated workflow
# 1. Start new Cursor session
# 2. Ask for help with complex feature
# 3. Verify AI follows all implemented patterns:
#    - Uses copyable question format
#    - Considers security implications
#    - Follows TDD if appropriate
#    - Maintains quality standards
#    - Uses systematic problem-solving
#    - Maintains conversation context
```

## Maintenance and Optimization

### Regular Rule Review Process

```bash
# Monthly rule review script
cat > review-rules.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Cursor Rules Review - $(date)"
echo "================================"

echo "Rule files:"
find .cursor/rules -name "*.mdc" -exec basename {} \;

echo ""
echo "Recent rule updates:"
git log --oneline --since="30 days ago" -- .cursor/rules/

echo ""
echo "Rule effectiveness checklist:"
echo "[ ] Communication: Are AI interactions more efficient?"
echo "[ ] Security: Are security issues caught early?"  
echo "[ ] Workflow: Is development process smoother?"
echo "[ ] Quality: Is code quality improved?"
echo "[ ] Problem-solving: Are issues resolved faster?"
echo "[ ] Conversation: Are complex projects better managed?"
EOF

chmod +x review-rules.sh
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Track rule effectiveness metrics
cat > track-metrics.md << 'EOF'
# Cursor Rules Effectiveness Tracking

## Baseline Metrics (Before Rules)
- Average AI conversation cycles: [X]
- Code review cycles: [X]
- Time to resolve bugs: [X hours]
- Security issues per month: [X]

## Current Metrics (With Rules)
- Average AI conversation cycles: [Y]
- Code review cycles: [Y]
- Time to resolve bugs: [Y hours]  
- Security issues per month: [Y]

## Improvement Calculation
- AI efficiency: [(X-Y)/X * 100]% improvement
- Review efficiency: [(X-Y)/X * 100]% improvement
- Debug efficiency: [(X-Y)/X * 100]% improvement
- Security improvement: [(X-Y)/X * 100]% improvement
EOF
```

### Rule Optimization Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with Communication and Security rules only
2. **Measure Impact:** Track metrics before and after implementation
3. **Iterate Gradually:** Add complexity based on team adoption
4. **Team Feedback:** Regular retrospectives on rule effectiveness
5. **Custom Adaptation:** Modify rules based on specific team needs

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

```markdown
## Common Issues and Solutions

### Rules Not Loading
**Problem:** AI not following defined rules
**Solutions:**
- Check file path: ~/.cursor/rules/ or .cursor/rules/
- Verify file format: Must be .mdc extension
- Check YAML frontmatter syntax
- Restart Cursor IDE

### Rules Too Restrictive  
**Problem:** AI responses feel limited or robotic
**Solutions:**
- Reduce number of active rules
- Make rules more flexible (guidelines vs strict requirements)
- Use context-aware rules instead of always-apply

### Team Adoption Issues
**Problem:** Team not following or understanding rules
**Solutions:**
- Provide training sessions
- Start with essential rules only
- Document clear examples and benefits
- Get team input on rule effectiveness
```
