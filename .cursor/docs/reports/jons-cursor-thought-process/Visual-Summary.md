## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Recognize the Moment
Ask yourself: *"Am I working with technology outside my AI's current expertise?"*

**Triggers:**
- New APIs or integration platforms
- Platform-specific requirements (iOS, macOS, Windows)
- Compliance or accessibility needs
- Unfamiliar development tools

### Step 2: Request Specialist Knowledge
**Copy-Paste Template:**
```
"I notice we're working with [TECHNOLOGY]. Could you give me three documents I can index that will make you a specialist on [TECHNOLOGY]?

I'm looking for:
1. Primary Documentation: Official user guide or comprehensive overview
2. Technical Integration: Developer/API documentation or technical specifications  
3. Specialized Context: Accessibility, compliance, or domain-specific requirements

This will help you provide more accurate, platform-specific solutions immediately."
```

### Step 3: Apply and Verify
- **Immediate Implementation:** Use specialist knowledge right away
- **Quality Check:** Verify improved accuracy and platform compliance
- **Document Success:** Note time savings and solution quality improvements
