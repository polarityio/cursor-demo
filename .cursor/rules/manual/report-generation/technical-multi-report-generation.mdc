# Multi-Document Analysis Package Generator
*Systematic approach to professional technical reports*

## 🎯 Rule Purpose

**Generate complete analysis packages (6+ documents) for professional distribution.** This rule creates comprehensive, vendor-neutral reports with verified citations and multiple output formats.

**🚀 Execution Mode:** Ask 4-5 focused questions → Execute autonomously → Deliver finished 6+ document package

---

## ⚡ Structured Question Framework

### 🎯 **Question Template** (USE EXACTLY THESE)
```
I'll create a comprehensive analysis package with 6+ professional documents. I need 4-5 key pieces of information:

1. ANALYSIS SCOPE: What specific aspects need analysis? 
   (e.g., "Compare 5 project management tools focusing on integration capabilities" vs "General project management landscape")

2. DISTRIBUTION METHOD: Where will this be shared and with whom?
   (e.g., "Slack channels for dev team + email to leadership" vs "Documentation wiki for entire company")

3. TARGET AUDIENCE: Who makes decisions based on this?
   (e.g., "Technical leads and engineering manager" vs "C-suite and procurement team")

4. REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRAINTS: Any budget, timeline, or feature requirements?
   (e.g., "Budget under £1000/month, must integrate with GitHub, decision needed within 2 weeks")

5. VERIFICATION LEVEL: Should I verify all external links and sources?
   (e.g., "Yes, this is for compliance documentation" vs "Standard verification for internal use")

That's all I need. I'll then create a comprehensive 6+ document package autonomously.
```

### 🔄 **Information Gathering Strategy**
```
✅ Ask all 4-5 questions at once (not sequentially)
✅ Don't seek extensive clarification unless critical gaps exist
✅ If user provides partial answers, proceed with reasonable assumptions
✅ Start comprehensive generation immediately after getting responses
✅ Focus on delivering complete finished package, not iterative refinement
```

## ⚡ Autonomous Execution Process

### 1️⃣ **After Getting User Responses** (IMMEDIATE START)
```
Confirm understanding and scope:
"Creating comprehensive analysis package for [SCOPE] targeting [AUDIENCE] via [DISTRIBUTION] with [CONSTRAINTS]. Generating 6+ document package with [VERIFICATION LEVEL] now."

Then proceed automatically through entire package generation.
```

### 2️⃣ **Document Generation** (SYSTEMATIC CREATION)
```
Create complete package:
□ Technical Report (detailed analysis with citations)
□ Comparison Matrix (feature tables and scoring)  
□ Visual Summary (Slack/Teams copy-paste ready)
□ Implementation Guide (step-by-step procedures)
□ Decision Tree (guided selection framework)
□ README Navigation (package overview and index)

Generate all documents without seeking intermediate approval.
```

### 3️⃣ **Quality Standards** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
```
Every document must include:
□ Verifiable data sources and citations
□ Vendor-neutral analysis with trade-offs
□ Professional formatting and structure
□ Implementation guidance and next steps
□ Clear recommendations based on use cases
□ Copy-paste ready formats for distribution
```

## 🚀 Autonomous Generation Guidelines

### ✅ **Proceed Automatically With:**
```
Standard assumptions when detailed info is missing:
- Team size: Based on context clues or assume mid-market (20-50 people)
- Budget: Industry standard ranges for category and team size
- Timeline: Standard business decision cycle (4-8 weeks)
- Technical complexity: Mixed technical/business stakeholder environment
- Integration needs: Modern standard tools (Git, CI/CD, communication platforms)
- Security requirements: Standard business security practices
```

### 🎯 **Focus Areas for Comprehensive Analysis:**
```
Deep verification and analysis:
- Market position and adoption metrics
- Feature completeness and roadmap analysis
- Integration capabilities and ecosystem
- Pricing models and total cost of ownership
- Security and compliance considerations
- Vendor stability and support quality
- Implementation complexity and timeline
```

### 📝 **Professional Standards** (MAINTAIN THROUGHOUT)
```
Each document includes:
- Executive summary with key insights
- Methodology and data sources section
- Comparative analysis with objective metrics
- Implementation guidance and timeline
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Clear recommendations by use case and scenario
- External links and authoritative citations
- Professional presentation suitable for stakeholders
```

---

## ✅ Verification and Quality Requirements

### 🔗 **Citations & Sources**
```
Required for every factual claim:
- User adoption metrics with official sources
- Market position data with verification links
- Feature comparisons with documentation references
- Pricing information with official source confirmation
- Community activity with measurable data
- Security certifications with official documentation
- Performance benchmarks with source attribution
```

### ⚖️ **Vendor Neutrality**
```
Maintain throughout analysis:
- Equal treatment in analysis depth and presentation
- Present limitations alongside strengths for every option
- Include trade-offs and potential drawbacks
- Use comparative market analysis, not isolated features
- Never mention specific individuals by name
- Focus on objective criteria and measurable factors
```

### 📝 **Professional Formatting**
```
Consistent structure across all documents:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Clear methodology and data source section
- Comparative analysis with supporting metrics
- Implementation guidance with realistic timelines
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Clear recommendations segmented by use case
- Working external links and proper citations
- Last updated date and version information
```

## 🎯 Communication Patterns

### 💬 **Autonomous Professional Language:**
```
Use confident, research-backed phrases:
- "Based on market analysis across [X] sources..."
- "According to verified data from [source with link]..."
- "Comprehensive evaluation shows trade-offs include..."
- "For your specific requirements and constraints..."
- "Implementation roadmap includes these phases..."
- "Decision framework recommends [option] based on..."
```

### 🔄 **Execution Flow:**
```
1. "Creating comprehensive analysis package for [summary of understanding]"
2. [Generate all 6+ documents systematically without consultation]
3. "Here's your complete professional analysis package with navigation guide:"
4. [Present final results with usage recommendations]
```

## 🚫 Comprehensive Analysis Guidelines

### ❌ **Don't Do This (Breaks Autonomous Flow):**
- Ask incremental questions between documents
- Seek approval for each document before proceeding
- Request preferences for analysis methodology
- Wait for feedback before generating next document
- Ask for detailed technical specifications during generation

### ✅ **Do This (Delivers Complete Results):**
- Generate entire package based on initial requirements
- Use industry-standard analysis frameworks
- Make informed assumptions based on context
- Focus on comprehensive, professional output
- Deliver complete package ready for stakeholder review

- Professional documentation for decision audit trails

### 🚀 **Use Quick Analysis instead for:**
- Time-critical decisions (days not weeks)
- Small team contexts (under 20 people)
- Single stakeholder group
- Proof-of-concept or initial evaluations

### 🎯 **Use Technical Report instead for:**
- Maximum accuracy verification requirements
- High-stakes compliance-driven decisions
- Need for source quality ratings and link verification
- Context preservation for long-term reference
