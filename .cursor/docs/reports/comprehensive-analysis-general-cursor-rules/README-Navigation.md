## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### ❌ **Rules Not Working**
```
Symptoms: AI not following defined rules
Solutions:
1. Check file locations (.cursor/rules/ vs ~/.cursor/rules/)
2. Verify .mdc file format and frontmatter
3. Restart Cursor IDE
4. Check rule activation in Cursor settings
5. Simplify rules if too complex
```

### 😤 **Team Resistance** 
```
Symptoms: Team not adopting or following rules
Solutions:
1. Start with minimal, high-value rules only
2. Demonstrate clear benefits with examples
3. Get team input on rule effectiveness
4. Adjust rules based on team feedback
5. Provide training and support
```

### ⚡ **Performance Issues**
```
Symptoms: Cursor slower or less responsive
Solutions:  
1. Reduce number of active rules
2. Use context-aware rules instead of always-apply
3. Simplify rule content and language
4. Monitor token usage and optimize
5. Consider rule hierarchy optimization
```

### 🔄 **Maintenance Overhead**
```
Symptoms: Rules requiring too much maintenance
Solutions:
1. Focus on stable, proven patterns
2. Automate rule updates where possible
3. Designate rule champions for maintenance
4. Regular review and cleanup schedule
5. Document rule effectiveness and ROI
```
